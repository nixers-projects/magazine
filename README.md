# magazine
open source magazine for unix nerds

## todos

- Open a titanpad so everyone (even the ones that are not going to participate) write as many ideas as possible
- Choose a default template of the magazine, for example what kind of sections we will have. Those sections will be in every release for coherency.
- Assign sections and taks to people, namely: writers, artists, people joining it inside a pdf so we can preview, reviewers, a lot of proofreaders, managing the handouts, managing the sales, etc..
- Test the process by making our first test-release.
- Finish a draft-release and open a kikstarter campaign so that we at least have something to propose.


## roadmap

- decide on basic branding
- decide on content
- create kickstarter displaying these
- collect, review, compile content
- add finishing touches
- ship out
